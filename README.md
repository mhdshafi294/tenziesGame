# The Tenzies Game Project

This is a project I did with a Scrimba React.js course, and at the end I added these features by my self for extra credit;
1. Puted real dots on the dice
2. Tracked the number of rolls
3. Tracked the time it took to win
4. Saved both of them to track any new records
5. added a stopwatch on the screen for the user.

Download it and enjoy!, or you can visit this link https://jolly-cucurucho-b564de.netlify.app/ to try it directly. Have fun! I would love any feedback.




## Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
